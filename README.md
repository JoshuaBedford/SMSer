This is a simple signup form that registers the users phone number in the database, and sends them a welcome message.

Currently I have it sending 'FROM' my email address, as I do not know how to send as a phone number. If you do know, please don't hesitate to say so or submit a pull request!

In the files above is a spreadsheet of the carriers I got from the web and use in the database to get the carrier's gateway of the carrier the user selects as their own.

Any questions? Just ask!
